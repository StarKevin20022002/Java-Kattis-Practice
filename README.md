Hi, my name is Mai Trong Nhan, a 3rd year student at Vietnamese - German University, who is currently on an exchange program at the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences (Germany).
This rep. will be the place where I include Kattis coding exercises at school, as well as extra ones to strenghen my Java skills.
I'm looking forward to seeing you soon, and hopefully getting an offer from you!
